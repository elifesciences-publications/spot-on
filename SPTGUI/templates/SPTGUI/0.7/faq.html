<h2 class="blog-post-title">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>What is Spot-On?</h3>
<p>Spot-On is an online tool to extract kinetic parameters from fast single particle tracking experiments. It does it in a manner that takes into account the finite depth of field of the objective and proposes corrections for that. Spot-On can fit two-states (Bound-Free) and three-states (Bound-Free1-Free2) models.</p>

<p>Spot-On takes a set of trajectories as input (<a href="#input-formats">multiple formats supported</a>) and outputs a fitted jump length distribution, together with goodness-of-fit metrics and the corresponding fitted coefficients.</p>
  

<h3>What is not Spot-On?</h3>
<p> Spot-On is not a tracking algorithm, thus you need to perform the tracking of your single particle tracking datasets using a separed algorithm. Spot-On accepts inputs from a range of <a href="#input-formats">popular tracking softwares</a>, and you can either add your own or write a converter towards a standard table-file import.</p>

<h3>What tracking software to use?</h3>

<h3>What type of input Spot-On accepts?</h3>

<p>See <a href="#input-formats">this section of the documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>My input format does not seem to be supported, what can I do?</h3>

<p>If the format of the tracking algorithm you use is not supported by Spot-On, here are a few things you can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you believe that this format should be added to Spot-On, feel free to contact us, either through our <a href="{% url 'SPTGUI:contactform' %}">contact page</a> or by creating an issue on our <a href="https://gitlab.com/padouppadoup/Spot-On/">Gitlab bugtracker</a>.</li>
  <li>Meantime, you can try to convert your file to one of the formats supported by Spot-On. A description of the <a href="#input-formats">formats supported by Spot-On</a> is presented above. For instance, the CSV format has a very simple syntax.</li>
  <li> If you have programming skills, feel free to write an importer! The structure of the parser is documented in the <code>/SPTGUI/parsers.py</code> file. Do not forget to open an issue on the bugtracker so that we are aware that you are working on a specific file format.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How fast is Spot-On?</h3>
<p> During our tests that included up to 1 million detections, the computation of the jump length distribution and the fitting of the most complicated kinetic model (3 states with estimation of the localization error from the data) usually takes about one minute.</p>
<p> That said, the fitting speed depends on many parameters (load of the server, range of the parameters, shape of your jump length distribution, etc). If the online version of Spot-On is performing too slowly for your needs, feel free to get either the <a href="https://gitlab.com/padouppadoup/Spot-On/">offline version of Spot-On</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/DarzacqLab/fastspt"> command line version</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you just fitting a two-exponential model?</h3>

<p> This is slightly more complicated, for several reasons presented in details in the <a href="methods">methods section</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spot-On can perform both two- and three-populations fitting</li>
  <li>Spot-On can estimate the localization error from the data</li>
  <li>As fast populations tend to move out of focus more than bound molecules, the estimate of the fraction of the molecules in each state is usually heavily biased towards slow-moving particles. Spot-On implements a previously-published semi-empirical correction to account for that.</li>
  <li> Spot-On implements quality checks to warn the user when the uploaded datasets seem to show inconsistencies or were performed in conditions that might lead to unreliable parameter estimation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I'm afraid of uploading my dataset to your server. Is there an offline version?</h3>

<p> Sure! Spot-On is fully <a href="{% url 'SPTGUI:staticpage' 'license' %}">free/open-source</a> and detailed download and installation instructions can be retrieved from our <a href="https://gitlab.com/padouppadoup/Spot-On/">Gitlab page</a>.</p>

<h3>Is there a command-line version?</h3>
<p> There is! Spot-On uses an independent command-line Python backend that is available in our <a href="https://github.com/DarzacqLab/fastspt">Github repository</a>. It implements most of the features of Spot-On, comes with simple wrapper functions that can quickly be implemented in your scripting framework.</p>

<h3>What technology uses Spot-On?</h3>
<p> Spot-On is written in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>. The backend relies on the <a href="https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/">lmfit</a> library. The server is based on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and uses <a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> to run an asynchronous queue to perform jobs. The frontend is written in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and the graphs are rendered through <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>.</p>
  
<h3>Is there a MatlabÂ® version?</h3>
<p>There is! Check this page (to be updated soon, <a href="{% url 'SPTGUI:contactform' %}">contact us</a> to get the version as soon as we release it).</p>
