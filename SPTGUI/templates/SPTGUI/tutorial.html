<p>This section of the Spot-On documentation will guide you through a sample analysis with a couple of demonstration files and will provide you with an overview of Spot-On features and options.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
  <h4>Step 1: start an analysis with demonstration files</h4>
  <p> To access the demonstration files, go to the <a href="{% url 'SPTGUI:index' %}">Spot-On homepage</a> and scroll to the "Get Started section" (or alternatively click the <a href="{% url 'SPTGUI:index' %}#start" class="btn btn-default btn-sm">Start spotting!</a> button on the top menu. First fill in the "I'm not a robot" CAPTCHA. Then you have the option to either upload your own tracking files and start your analysis or start with demo files. We choose this later option for the purpose of this tutorial.</p>

<p> This option will load the analysis page and will automatically import some demonstration file. Also, a custom and permanent URL is created. Your analyses will accessible from this URL until you choose to delete them. Do not share this URL if you want your datasets and analyses to remain private. You might want to bookmark it in order to reaccess the data later. Note that if you lose this address, there is no way for you to recover your files, since your upload is totally anonymous (we do not collect your identity or email address).</p>

<h3> Overview of the application </h3>
<p> First of all, Spot-On is organized into <em>four successive tabs</em>. These tabs are populated one after the other (that is, for instance, the "Kinetic modeling" tab remains blank as long as no dataset has been uploaded in the "Data" tab, etc). The four tabs are (<span class="red">&#x2460;</span> in the screenshot below):</p>

<table class="table table-striped">

    <th class="col-md-10">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="col-md-2">Data</td>
    <td class="col-md-10">This tab allows you to upload your datasets in various formats in a batch mode, to annotate them, and to see statistics both for individual datasets and for the ensemble of uploaded files.</td>

<p>The "Upload dataset" region (<span class="red">&#x2461;</span> in the screenshot below), where you can upload from various file formats. Clicking on any of the format will display a box where you can enter additional upload parameters, and will ultimately display a drag-and-drop upload box. Accepted formats are described in more details in the <a href="#input-formats">Input formats</a> section below.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"> For the purpose of this tutorial, the data have already been loaded, so we won't play with this part of the page</div>

<p> The "Uploaded datasets" region (<span class="red">&#x2462;</span> in the screenshot below), that displays the uploaded datasets, together with their status (<code>uploading</code>, <code>queued</code>, <code>error</code>). The meaning of the upload codes is detailed in the <a href="#import-codes">Import codes</a> section below. When clicking on the "eye" symbol (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span>) next to an uploaded dataset will display some statistics in the area  <span class="red">&#x2463;</span>.

<p> These files correspond to a subset of an experimental series spanning ~1500 cells in several conditions for various transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins, acquired at various framerates and durations of stroboscopic illumination. This dataset is described in more details in the <a href="#datasets">Datasets</a> section.

<p>Five of these correspond to the transcription factor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX2">Sox2</a> is endogeneously tagged with a HaloTag and observed with the PA-JF646<b>add reference</b> organic dye. Five other correspond to the observation of histone H2B.</p>

  <h4>Step 2: rename and tag the uploaded files</h4>
  <p> Since the naming convention of these files is a little bit cumbersome, let's first edit the description of each file to make it clearer. To do so, click on the "pencil" icon (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>, see <span class="red">&#x2465;</span>) next to each uploaded dataset. An "edit" box will appear at the bottom of the "Uploaded datasets" area, and we can now either rename or add a more explicit description of the datasets. We choose to leave the name as is, but add a short description for each dataset, such as "H2B cell1", "H2B cell2", etc. (<span class="red">&#x2466;</span>)</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger"> The uploaded dataset comprises two distinct proteins, and five replicates for each protein. In the next steps, we want to make sure that we pool the replicates of each protein together, but do not mix up the two proteins.</div>

<h3>Quality check</h3>
<p>Now that we see a little bit clearer through the datasets, let's inspect a little bit the datasets, and try to assess the quality of the dataset. Spot-On provides a few quality metrics (statistics), accessible for each dataset by clicking the "eye" button (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span>).</p>

<p> <b>Comment on the main features of the dataset</b>. Although the number of jumps is not extremely high, we need to keep in mind that we plan to pool this dataset with four other datasets, which should overcome the limited size of this dataset. In case we encounter a dataset of unsuitable quality, we can exclude it by clicking the "cross" button (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span>) next to the dataset.</p>

<p>Once that we are confident about the quality of the uploaded data, we can proceed to the second tab, the "Kinetic modeling".</p>

<h4>Computation of the jump length distribution</h4>
<p> For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll simply fit the H2B and Sox2 datasets separately, and compare the two-states and three-states models based on their goodness of fit (assessed by the Bayesian Information Criterion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion">BIC</a>).</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"> <h4>Step 4: compute the empirical jump length distribution for the Sox2 datasets</h4>

  <p> First, in the "Dataset selection" select the five Sox2 replicates. This is done by switching the "Include" toggle button to "On" next to the Sox2 datasets. Make sure that none of the H2B datasets are included.</p>

     class="img-responsive center-block"
       style="max-width: 60%;"
       alt="Selection of Sox2 datasets.">
  
  <p> We can then set the parameters to compute the jump length distribution. We will mostly leave the parameters as default. Section <a href="jld-parameters">Jump length distribution computation parameters</a> describe the role of each parameter in more details.</p>

  <p> Then click the <span class="btn btn-default">Compute!</span> button. After a few seconds, the jump length distribution is computed for all the datasets and appears under the "Jump length distribution" section.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"> <h4>Step 5: play with the display options</h4>

  <p> The graph displayed should be read as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each row corresponds to a jump length distribution evaluated at a given \(\Delta t\). Since short trajectories are more frequent than long trajectories, higher \(\Delta t\) histograms tend to be less populated and appear less smooth (or more "noisy"). The number of rows is determined by the "Number of timepoints" parameter.</li>
    <li> The jump length distribution is computed for values ranging between 0 Âµm and 3 Âµm (this corresponds to the "Max Jump" parameter). However, by default, only the first 1.2 Âµm are initially plotted. To plot the full histogram (or alternatively, to zoom to the origin), the "Max Jump displayed" cursor, located under the plot can be adjusted. </li>
    <li> Then, by default, the jump length distribution is displayed for individual datasets. The displayed dataset is specified in the "Display dataset" box under the plot. It is often useful to take the time to review the jump length distribution of each single acquisition, in order to know which datasets might have to be excluded from further analysis.</li>
    <li> Once individual datasets have been reviewed, it is possible to display the pooled jump length distribution by clicking the "Show pooled jump length distribution" toggle button under the plot. This will compute the distribution for the selected datasets only (in our case, for all the Sox2 datasets). Pooled histograms appear with a hard, black boundary, and the included datasets are displayed under the graph. The updated graph might take a few seconds to render.</li>
  </ul>

<p> A few comments arise. First, the estimated fraction bound is about 70 %, which is expected from a strongly DNA-associated protein such as H2B. The associated coefficient with the bound population is close to zero (0.024 ÂµmÂ²/s) whereas the diffusion coefficient for the free population (3.94 ÂµmÂ²/s) matches previous knowledge of the dynamics of the protein.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the \(\ell_2\) error (the mean square error) is   \(\lt 10^{-4}\), which can be considered as acceptable, even though significant misfit appear at low and high \(\Delta t\).</p>
									   
<p> Finally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion">AIC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion">BIC</a> criterion are provided to allow model comparison. They cannot be used to assess the quality of fit per se. We will come back to those criteria later.</p>

  <p>Then, we can save the displayed fit by clicking the <span class="btn btn-default btn-sm">Mark for download</span> button.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"> <h4>Step 10: fit the Sox2 dataset with a two-states model</h4>
  <p> We can now proceed similarly to derive the fit for the Sox2 datasets.</p>
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"> <h4>Step 11: fit a three-states model</h4>
  <p> Finally, we can now see how the quality of the fit increases by running the fit again, but with a 3-states model. Select the 3-state model icon (Slow-Bound-Fast) on the "Model fitting" box. New parameters appear, very similarly as with the two-states model. We will leave the parameters to their default values, except for the CDF fit. Then click the <span class="btn btn-default btn-sm">Fit kinetic model</span> button and wait a until the fitting completes. Observe how the quality of fit evolves, and the parameters and estimated fractions.</p>

<p> Based on the information criteria, it is clear that the 3-states model provides a better fit to the data, even when penalizing for the number of parameters. </p>

<div class="alert alert-info"> Be careful when interpreting a 3-states model. Indeed, although a two-states model usually appears robust to model mismatch, a 3-states model can fit a wide range of distributions, and the estimated coefficients might be model specific. For instance, the model can invoke a third component to explain what actually is anomalous diffusion.</div>
