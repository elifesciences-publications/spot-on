<h2 class="blog-post-title">Software reference</h2>

<p>This section describes in detail the function of all the features and options implemented into Spot-On.</p>

<h3 id="input-formats">Input formats </h3>
<p>Spot-On accepts tracking files from the following software and raw CSV (column naming below): <a href="http://imagej.net/Getting_started_with_TrackMate">TrackMate</a>, <a href="http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=downloads/imageJ">MOSAIC suite</a>, evalSPT (a variant of MTT) and an additional custom Matlab format. Sometimes, the importer can be a little bit picky. We provide sample files for these formats so that you can potentially study them. In case you have a problematic file, do not hesitate to <a href="{% url 'SPTGUI:staticpage' 'contact' %}">contact us</a> and email us the problematic file.</p>


<h4 id="csv"> CSV (Comma-separated values)</h4>

<p> Files can be uploaded as raw CSV files. Make sure that the separator indeed is a comma (<em>,</em>). Importing from a tab-separated or semicolon-separated file will not work. The CSV file should have a header line and contain the following columns. Any other column will be ignored. The order of the columns does not matter. Note that the header naming convention is <em>case sensitive</em>. This importer assumes that tracking has been performed already and that sets of detections were assigned a numerical index (or trajectory id). </p>

<h4 id="trackmate"> TrackMate </h4>

<p>
  <a href="http://imagej.net/Getting_started_with_TrackMate">TrackMate</a> is an <a href="http://imagej.net">ImageJ</a>/<a href="http://fiji.sc">Fiji</a> plugin that can perform various types of tracking and export the traces to various file formats. Spot-On can import from its XML and CSV export.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>Note that the file has to be exported from the last panel of the wizard (clicking the "Save" button at the bottom of the window will produce a XML file that cannot be read by Spot-On). A screenshot of TrackMate's export interface is displayed below.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    TrackMate saves the framerate of the movie in the exported XML file. However, for some reasons, this can be unproperly set. See the ImageJ documentation about how to set up the framerate. <em>The framerate has to be set in 'ms' (milliseconds) to be recognized by Spot-On.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the .xml file exported by TrackMate, the recorded framerate is indicated in the <code>frameInterval</code> field, and the saved unit in the <code>timeUnits</code> field. You can safely manually edit those values in case they were not saved when performing the tracking.
  </p>

<h4 id="utrack"> UTrack </h4>
<p><a href="http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/danuser/software/#utrack_anc">u-track</a> is an Matlab software that can perform various types of tracking and export the traces to a custom Matlab format. Spot-On can import it provided that no branching was allowed in the settings. Below are some suggested parameters:</p>

<pre>
gapCloseParam.timeWindow = 1; %maximum allowed time gap (in frames) between a track segment end and a track segment start that allows linking them.
gapCloseParam.mergeSplit = 0; %1 if merging and splitting are to be considered, 2 if only merging is to be considered, 3 if only splitting is to be considered, 0 if no merging or splitting are to be considered. 
gapCloseParam.minTrackLen = 1; %minimum length of track segments from linking to be used in gap closing.
</pre>

<p>Note that if <code>gapCloseParam.mergeSplit</code> is set to 1, Spot-On will not be able to read the format and will silently fail.</p>

<p>We are very grateful to Khuloud Jaqaman (UT Southwestern) and Gaudenz Danuser (UT Southwestern) for precisions about this file format.</p>

  <a href="http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=downloads/imageJ">MOSAIC suite</a> is an <a href="http://imagej.net">ImageJ</a>/<a href="http://fiji.sc">Fiji</a> plugin that can perform tracking and export the traces as an ImageJ table. This table can be further exported to CSV. The table is displayed by clicking the "All Trajectories to table" and "Selected Trajectories to table" at the end of the wizard.

<p><code>evalSPT</code> (software mentioned in <a href="#normanno" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="normanno-ref">Normanno et al, 2015</a>) produces a TSV format (tab-separated values), with no header, with the first columns ordered as follows. Additional columns might be present but will be ignored. An example file is provided below.

<h4 id="matlab"> Matlab file format </h4>
<p>Spot-On also accepts a custom Matlab file format. An example is provided below. The <code>trackedPar</code> variable is a structured array. Each element of this array corresponds to one trajectory. Each trajectory contains several fields: <code>xy</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>frame</code>. Each of these fields is a 2D-matrix with 2, 1 and 1 columns, respectively and a number of rows corresponding to the number of detections for this trajectory.</p>

<p>Note that this format (in particularx the shape of the objects) has to be followed rigorously for Spot-On to be able to import it. In particular, a \(N\times 1\) matrix is different from a \(1\times N\) matrix. </p>

<h3 id="dataset-statistics">Dataset statistics</h3>

<p>Once a dataset has been successfully imported, several statistics are displayed and allow you to get a quick overview of the data, and spot dubious datasets or datasets that might likely need to unreliable analyses. We detail below how theses statistics are computed and what are suggested reference values.</p>

<table class="table table-condensed">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of traces</td>
    <td>The number of trajectories in the dataset. Trajectories can be singletons (one detection) and arbitrary long.</td>
    <td>A low number of traces will cause the jump length histograms to be noisy and limit the accuracy of model-fitting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of frames</td>
    <td>The duration of the acquisition (in frames). This is inferred as the maximum index of the "frame" field. If you do not have detections at the end of the movie, this number can be lower than the true number of frames.</td>
    <td>This number should more or less match the number of frames for the acquisition of this dataset.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of detections</td>
    <td>The number of particles detected.</td>
    <td>Too low a number of detections is problematic since background noise will make a bigger contribution, whereas too high may suggest tracking errors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<h3 id="jld-parameters">Jump length distribution computation parameters</h3>

The empirical jump length distribution is computed according to several parameters that are detailed below.

<table class="table table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bin width (µm)</td>
    <td>how finely to do binning for PDF fitting and plotting in
units of micrometers. Generally, 0.010 μm or 10 nm is reasonable, but
if you have very small amounts of data you may want to increase it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of timepoints</td>
    <td>How many time points to consider. If you allow \(N\) time points, this corresponds to considering displacements with a maximal time-delay of \((N-1)\Delta t\). Generally, we do not recommend going much above 50-60 ms unless you have an a very large number of trajectories and/or very long trajectories, since otherwise, the displacement histograms at longer \(\Delta t\) tend to be undersampled.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jumps to consider</td>
    <td>The number of jumps per trajectory actually used to build the histogram. This is emppirically useful to correct for overcounting of slow-molecules not accounted for by the corrections implemented in the algorithme (for instance for undercounting due to motion-blur). Here, for each trajectory, 4 jumps (if possible) will be used to build the jump length histogram. For example, if Number of timepoints=8 and JumpsToConsider=4, a trajectory of 9 frames will contribute 4 jumps to 1dT, 4 jumps to 2 dT, …, and 2 jumps to 7 dT. This is a semi-empirical way of correcting for additional biases towards bound molecules.
      This parameter is ignored if "Use all trajectories" is set to Yes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Use all trajectories?</td>
    <td>If "Use all trajectories" is set to "Yes", the previous parameter ("Jumps to consider" is being ignored. If set to "Yes", all displacements will be used from
each trajectory. If set to "No", then the number of displacements is determined by the "Jumps to consider" variable. A trajectory of \(N\) frames, will contribute \(N-1\) displacements to the \(1\Delta t\) histogram, \(N-2\) displacements to the \(2\Delta t\), histogram,  ..., \(N-k\) displacements to the \(k\Delta t\) histogram.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Max jump (µm)</td>
    <td>this parameter affects data-processing. For binning displacements, a maximum displacement has to be set, so this parameter should be set to a large value that should be at least as big as the largest displacement. Generally, 5.05 μm is reasonable for single-molecule tracking data in mammalian cells.</td>

    <td>The number of diffusive states in the model. Spot-On supports 2- or 3-state. In most single-molecule tracking experiments of molecules that can engage
scaffolds (e.g. transcription factors, which may bind chromatin), one of these states will correspond to a bound state. In the case of Halo-CTCF in human U2OS cells, this will manifest itself as the chromatin-bound state of CTCF exhibiting a very small \(D\) for the bound state which likely corresponds to slow diffusion of
chromatin. The other states will correspond to freely diffusive states.</td>

If "Fit from data" is set to "Yes", Spot-On will try to infer this from the model-fitting. In that latter case, you need to provide an exploration range for these values. In the datasets provided with Spot-On, the localization error was around 35 nm. If the localization error parameter is set inaccurately, this will generally show up through poor fitting of the bound state and will cause the estimation of the bound diffusion constant to be inaccurate.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dZ (µm)</td>
    <td>Axial observation slice in units of micrometers. This parameter will depend somewhat on signal-to-noise conditions and imaging modality. But for a typical setup (HiLo or epi illumination, HaloTag or SNAP-Tag dyes), this is likely to be around 0.7 μm. The parameters tell Spot-On how far out-of-focus a molecule can be before it fails to be detected and it is important for accurately correcting for diffusing molecules gradually moving out-of-focus and thus being undersampled at longer time-intervals. In most cases 0.7 μm is reasonable, but for details on how to measure this please see (<a href="#hansen" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="hansen-ref"><em>Hansen et al. (2017)</em></a>.

  <tr>
    <td>Model Fit</td>
    <td>Determines whether fitting will be performed to the displacement histograms (PDF) or to the cumulative distribution function of displacements (CDF). We have performed Monte Carlo simulations and CDF-fitting is always more precise, whereas PDF-fitting tends to slightly underestimate the fraction bound and the diffusion constant, likely because PDF-fitting is more prone to binning artifacts and undersampling. Thus, for all quantitative analysis, CDF-fitting should be performed. However, displacement histograms often seem more intuitive, and for this reason Spot-On also allows PDF-fitting for making figures etc.</td>

  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>Iterations</td>
    <td>Spot-On fits a mathematical model to the data using least-squares fitting. Since this algorithm may occasionally get trapped in local minima in parameter space, for each iteration of the fitting Spot-On generates a random initial guess
of the parameters, which differs between each iteration. Thus, increasing the "Iterations" parameter, increases the probability that the globally optimal fit will be generated, but comes at the cost of slowing down the fitting. In practice, for all single-molecule tracking data we have tested so far, the globally best fit is always obtained in the first or second iteration of fitting, so we generally recommend keeping this parameter to 2-3.</td>
