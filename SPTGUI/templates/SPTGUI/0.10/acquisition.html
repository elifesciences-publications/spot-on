<h2 class="blog-post-title">How to acquire a "good" dataset?</h2>

<p>To obtain a good and reliable single-molecule tracking dataset, a series of requirements have to be met.</p>

<p>First of all, it must be possible to image single-molecules at a <b>high signal-to-noise ratio</b>. This is now relatively straightforward due to developments in fluorescence labeling strategies and imaging modalities. The development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HaloTag">HaloTag protein-labeling system</a> and bright, photo-stable organic Halo-dyes such as TMR and the JF dyes developed by Luke Lavis and co-workers now make it possible to easily visualize single protein molecules inside live cells. Moreover, imaging modalities such as <em>highly inclined and laminated optical sheet illumination</em> (<a href="#tokunaga" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="tokunaga-ref">Tokunaga et al, 2008</a>) are relatively straightforward to implement and combined with a high-quality EM-CCD camera make it possible to image single-molecules at high signal-to-noise suitable for generating high-quality 2D single-molecule tracking data. For details of our imaging setup which combines HaloTag-labeling with HiLo-illumination and which is relatively common and easy to operate, please see <a href="#hansen" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="hansen-ref">Hansen et al., 2017</a>. But we note that many other imaging modalities, e.g. light-sheet or even epi-fluorescence imaging can generate high-quality single-molecule tracking data. </p>

<p>Thus, in the following we will assume that the above condition is met: namely, that single protein molecules can be tracked inside live cells at high signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, even if this condition is met, there are at least 4 other major sources of bias:</p>

<ol>
<li> Detection: minimize “motion-blurring” </li>
<li> Tracking: minimize tracking errors</li>
<li> 3D loss: correct for molecules moving out-of-focus</li>
<li> Analysis: infer subpopulations with minimal bias</li>
</ol>

<p>Spot-On addresses point 3 and 4, as described elsewhere, but point 1 and 2 must be addressed in the experimental design. We discuss strategies to minimize these biases below (spaSMT). </p>

<h3>Detection – minimizing “motion-blurring” </h3>

<p>Almost all localization algorithms achieve sub-diffraction localization accuracy (“super-resolution”) by treating individual fluorophores as point-source emitters, which generate blurred images that can be described by that Point-Spread-Function (PSF) of the microscope. Modeling of the PSF (typically as a 2-dimensional Gaussian) then allows extraction of the particle centroid with a precision of 10s of nm. But as illustrated in the above section (“Motion blur”), while this works extremely well for bound molecules, fast-diffusing molecules will spread out their photons over many pixels during the microscope exposure and thus appear as “motion-blurs”. Thus, most localization algorithms will reliably detect bound molecules, but fail to detect fast-moving molecules. Clearly, the extent of the bias will depend on the exposure time and the diffusion constant: the longer the exposure and higher D, the worse the problem. Assuming Brownian motion, we can calculate the fraction of molecules that will move more than some number, \(r_{max}\), during an exposure time, \(t_{exp}\), given a free diffusion constant of \(D_{free}\) using the following equation:</p>

$$\mathbb{P}\left(r\gt r_{max} \right) = e^{-\frac{r_{max}^2}{4D_{free}t_{exp}}}$$

<p>For example, if we define motion-blurring as moving more than 2 pixels (&gt; 320 nm assuming a 160 nm pixel size) during the excitation, an exposure time of 10 ms and a typical free diffusion constant of 3.5 µm²/s (e.g. Sox2), we get:</p>

$$\mathbb{P}\left(r\gt r_{max} \right) = e^{-\frac{(0.32 \mu m)^2}{4 \times 3.5 \mu m^2s^{-1} \times 0.010 s}} \simeq 0.481$$

<p>Thus, even for a relatively slowly diffusing protein, with a 10 ms exposure we should expect almost half (48%) of all free molecules to show significant motion-blurring. The most straightforward solution is therefore to limit the exposure time: in the limit of an infinitely short exposure time, there is no motion-blur. In practice, most EM-CCD cameras can only image at ~100-200 Hz for reasonably sized ROIs. Moreover, it is generally desirable for the mean jump lengths to be significantly bigger than the localization error, thus for most nuclear factors in mammalian cells it is not desirable to image at above &gt; 250 Hz.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a reasonable solution is therefore to use stroboscopic illumination. That is, using brief excitation laser pulses that last shorter than the camera frame rate (e.g. 1 ms excitation pulse, 10 ms camera exposure time for a 100 Hz experiment): this achieves minimal motion-blurring while maintaining a useful frame-rate. However, this highlights a <em>key experimental trade-off</em>: shorter excitation pulses minimize motion-blurring, but also minimize the signal-to-noise. Therefore, a reasonable compromise has to be determined. Here we use 1 ms excitation pulses: this achieves minimal motion blurring (0.067% &gt; 320 nm using \(D=3.5 \mu m^2/s\)) and still yields very good signal (signal-to-background &gt; 5).</p>

<p>But users will need to decide this based on their expected \(D\) and their experimental setup (signal-to-noise). As we show here, the estimation of \(D\) is quite sensitive to motion-blurring, but the estimation of the bound fraction is less sensitive as long as the diffusion constant is &lt; 5 µm²/s. Generally speaking, we do not recommend imaging at a signal-to-background &lt; 3 and do not recommend using excitation pulses &gt; 5 ms, but the optimal conditions will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>In conclusion, experimentally implementing stroboscopic excitation makes it possible to minimize the bias coming from motion-blurring, while still achieving a sufficient signal for reliable localization.</p>

<h3>Tracking – minimizing tracking errors </h3>
<p>It is necessary to minimize tracking errors in order to obtain high-quality single-molecule tracking (SMT) data. Tracking errors bias the estimation of essentially all parameters we could want to estimate from SMT experiments including diffusion constants, subpopulations, anomalous diffusion etc.</p>

<p>While many different tracking algorithms exist, it is fundamentally impossible to perform tracking, that is connecting localized molecules between subsequent frames, at high densities without introducing many tracking errors. Thus, the simplest solution is to <em>image at low densities</em>: in principle, if there is only one labeled molecule per cell, there can be no tracking errors. However, because dyes generally bleach quite quickly, this has traditionally lead to a series trade-off between data quality and the number of trajectories which can be obtained.</p>
<p>However, with the recent development of bright photo-activatable JF-dyes (PA-dye;<a href="#grimm" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="grimm-ref">Grimm et al, 2016</a>), it is now possible to combine the superior brightness of the Halo-JF dyes with photo-activation SMT (<a href="#manley" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="manley-ref">Manley et al, 2008</a>). That is, a large fraction of Halo-tagged proteins in a cell can be labeled with Halo-PA-JF dyes and then photo-activated one at a time: this allows imaging at extremely low densities (&lt; 1 fluorescent molecule per cell per frame) and nevertheless obtain tens of thousands of trajectories from a single cell. Thus, PA-dyes now make it possible to nearly eliminate tracking errors without compromising on signal-to-noise or amount of data.</p>

<p>In fact, imaging at extremely low densities generally also improves signal-to-noise since out-of-focus background is reduced and overlapping point emitters are avoided. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, even with paSMT it is still necessary to decide on an optimal density. The key parameters are size of the ROI (ideally the whole nucleus for studies in cells) and \(D\): a large nucleus and a slow \(D\) can support a higher density than can fast-diffusing molecules in a small nucleus. As a general rule of thumb we recommend a density of ~1 fluorescent molecule per ROI per frame. This will keep tracking errors at a minimum and still support rapid acquisition of large datasets. All data acquired for this study was acquired at this density.</p>

<p>In practice, keeping an optimal density will require some trial-and-error optimization of the 405 nm photo-activation laser intensity. 405 nm excitation does contribute background fluorescence, so we prefer to pulse the 405 laser during the camera “dead-time” (~0.5 ms in our case) to avoid this. Moreover, this also makes it easier to keep the photo-activation level constant when changing the frame rate. However, the optimal photo-activation power will depend on the expression level of the protein, protein half-life and the dye concentration and will therefore have to be optimized in each case. We recommend recording initial datasets and then analyzing them using Spot-On which reports the mean number of localizations per frame and then using this information to determine the optimal photo-activation level. However, even then some cell-to-cell variation may be unavoidable: especially in transient transfection experiments where there is huge cell-to-cell variation in expression level or when studying proteins expressed from stably integrated transgenes (e.g. Halo-3xNLS and H2b-Halo in our case). In these cases, some cells will likely exhibit too high a density. To deal with this, Spot-On includes the option to analyze datasets from individual cells first and then excluding a cell with too high a density before analyzing the merged dataset. </p>

<h3 id="appropriate-datasets">Which datasets are appropriate for Spot-On?</h3>
<p>In the sections above, we have discussed how to minimize common experimental biases in SMT experiments and proposed spaSMT as a general solution. However, many 2D SMT datasets recorded under different conditions are also appropriate for Spot-On. For example, SMT experiments without photo-activation or with continuous illumination may also be appropriate for analysis with Spot-On. But since Spot-On uses the loss of fast-diffusing molecules over time to correct for bias and to estimate the free population, it is essential that all trajectories are included in Spot-On for analysis. For example, some tracking and localization algorithms ignore all trajectories below a certain length (e.g. 5 frames), but this will cause Spot-On to misestimate the loss of molecules moving out-of-focus and thus it is imperative that trajectories of all lengths be included when analyzing data using Spot-On. </p>

<p>Moreover, Spot-On does not currently support 3D SMT data. Furthermore, Spot-On assumes diffusion to be Brownian. This is a reasonable approximation even for molecules exhibiting some levels of anomalous diffusion, but Spot-On is not appropriate for molecules undergoing directed motion. Finally, the correction for molecules moving out-of-focus assumes that molecules are not fully confined within small compartments, that prevent molecules from moving out-of-focus.</p>
